# Lab extra - Play store

## Story

Imagine, you're a developer at Tootle Ltd., a multinational company with offices around the world. One day you suggest to create an online store for games. To get more traction, you decide to release a proof-of-concept and present it to your colleagues.

## Task

1. Pick a framework of your choice;
2. Implement at least 3 roles: `publisher`, `user` and anonymous visitor
3. Implement 2 types of content: `games` and `apps`;
4. Implement the core functions for the store:

- Publishers can create and edit content of the store (e.g. create game pages with links to download the game);
- Anybody can access games, but not download them;
- Users can access & download games and apps.

5. The play store has to look nice on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Special conditions

Neither Bootstrap nor Material UI can be used.

## Hints

- If you already know a framework - use it!
- If you don't, use Ruby on Rails.
- Use SQLite3 as RDBMS, if you're unsure what DBMS to use. Other good choices - PostgreSQL, MongoDB.
- Use CSS libraries for UI part.
